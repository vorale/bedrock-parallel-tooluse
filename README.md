# Parallel Tool Execution with Claude 4: Building High Performing Agents with Bedrock Converse API & Event Loop

*Unlocking the full potential of AI agents through concurrent tool execution and sophisticated event loops using direct Amazon Bedrock Converse API with Claude 4 models*

## Introduction

The evolution of AI agents has reached a pivotal moment with the introduction of parallel tool execution capabilities in Claude 4 models. This breakthrough technology transforms how AI systems interact with external tools, moving from sequential, time-consuming operations to lightning-fast concurrent execution within sophisticated agentic architectures.

But parallel tool execution isn't just about faster individual requests—it's the foundation for building advanced agentic systems that can maintain context, make decisions, execute complex multi-step workflows, and optimize resource usage through intelligent thread pool management across multiple iterations and state transitions.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to implement an **Agentic Event Loop using direct Amazon Bedrock Converse API** that leverages parallel tool execution with reusable thread pools, state management, and adaptive decision making to create truly intelligent AI agents that can handle complex, multi-iteration workflows while maximizing performance and resource efficiency.

## The Parallel Tool Execution Revolution

### What is Parallel Tool Execution in Agentic Systems?

Parallel tool execution in agentic systems allows AI models to invoke multiple tools simultaneously while maintaining context and state across multiple reasoning cycles. When an agent needs to "analyze code quality, run tests, check dependencies, and generate documentation," instead of executing these sequentially across multiple iterations, the agent can process all tools concurrently within its current state while preserving context for future decision making.

### Model Compatibility: The Claude 4 Advantage

**Critical Note**: Parallel tool execution is exclusively supported by the latest Claude models:

- **Claude 4 Sonnet** (`anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0`)
- **Claude 4 Opus** (`anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0`)
- **Claude 4.1 Opus** (`anthropic.claude-opus-4-1-20250805-v1:0`)
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** (`anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0`)

Earlier Claude models (3.5 Sonnet, 3 Haiku, etc.) do not support this capability and will execute tools sequentially. This makes upgrading to Claude 4 models essential for building high-performance agentic systems.

### The Advanced Bedrock Agentic Approach

Our implementation uses direct Amazon Bedrock Converse API with sophisticated agent architecture, reusable thread pools, and comprehensive state management:

```python
class AgenticBedrockLoop:
    """Agentic Event Loop using direct Bedrock Converse API"""
    
    def __init__(self, aws_region: str = "us-east-1", max_workers: int = 8):
        # Direct boto3 Bedrock client with retry configuration
        retry_config = Config(
            retries={'max_attempts': 10, 'mode': 'adaptive'},
            read_timeout=300, connect_timeout=60
        )
        
        self.client = boto3.client(
            'bedrock-runtime',
            region_name=self.aws_region,
            config=retry_config
        )
        
        self.model = "us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0"
        self.executor = None  # Reusable across entire agent lifecycle
        
    async def run_agent(self, user_message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute agent with Bedrock Converse API"""
        context = AgentContext(
            conversation_id=f"bedrock_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S_%f')}",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_message}],
            events=[], current_state=AgentState.IDLE, tool_results=[]
        )
        
        while (context.current_state != AgentState.COMPLETED and 
               context.current_state != AgentState.ERROR):
            
            if context.current_state == AgentState.THINKING:
                await self._handle_thinking_bedrock(context)
            elif context.current_state == AgentState.EXECUTING_TOOLS:
                await self._handle_tool_execution(context)
            elif context.current_state == AgentState.RESPONDING:
                await self._handle_responding_bedrock(context)
```

### Bedrock Message Format Conversion

The implementation handles conversion between standard message formats and Bedrock's specific requirements:

```python
async def _handle_thinking_bedrock(self, context: AgentContext):
    """Handle thinking state using Bedrock Converse API"""
    
    # Convert messages to Bedrock format
    bedrock_messages = []
    for msg in context.messages:
        if msg['role'] == 'user':
            if isinstance(msg['content'], str):
                bedrock_messages.append({
                    'role': 'user',
                    'content': [{'text': msg['content']}]
                })
            else:
                bedrock_messages.append({
                    'role': 'user', 
                    'content': msg['content']
                })
    
    # Convert tool schemas to Bedrock format
    bedrock_tools = []
    for tool in TOOL_SCHEMAS:
        bedrock_tool = {
            'toolSpec': {
                'name': tool['name'],
                'description': tool['description'],
                'inputSchema': {'json': tool['input_schema']}
            }
        }
        bedrock_tools.append(bedrock_tool)
    
    response = self.client.converse(
        modelId=self.model,
        messages=bedrock_messages,
        toolConfig={'tools': bedrock_tools},
        inferenceConfig={'maxTokens': 4000}
    )
```

### Thread Pool Management

```python
def __enter__(self):
    # Create thread pool once for entire agent lifecycle
    self.executor = concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(
        max_workers=self.max_workers,
        thread_name_prefix="AgentToolExecutor"
    )
        return self
    
    async def run_agent(self, user_message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Run complete agentic event loop with reusable thread pool"""
        context = AgentContext(...)
        
        while (context.current_state != AgentState.COMPLETED and 
               context.iteration_count < context.max_iterations):
            
            # Determine next state based on context and results
            next_state = await self._determine_next_state(context)
            await self._transition_state(context, next_state)
            
            # Execute state handler (may use parallel tools)
            await self.state_handlers[context.current_state](context)
```

## Advanced Parallel Tool Execution
- **Multi-iteration optimization**: Single thread pool serves entire agent lifecycle
- **State-based architecture**: THINKING → EXECUTING_TOOLS → PLANNING → RESPONDING
- **Resource efficiency**: No thread pool creation overhead between iterations
- **Complex workflows**: Supports multi-step reasoning and adaptive decision making
- **Context preservation**: Maintains state and memory across agent iterations

## Implementation Deep Dive

### Agentic Event Loop Architecture

Our implementation leverages Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` within a sophisticated state-based agent system:

```python
async def _execute_tools_parallel_async(self, tool_calls: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Execute tools in parallel using the reusable ThreadPoolExecutor
    Integrated into the agentic event loop for multi-iteration efficiency
    """
    if not self.executor:
        raise RuntimeError("ThreadPoolExecutor not initialized. Use context manager.")
    
    # Submit all tool executions to the reusable thread pool
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    futures = []
    
    for tool_call in tool_calls:
        future = loop.run_in_executor(
            self.executor,  # Reuse the same thread pool across iterations
            self._execute_single_tool,
            tool_call['name'],
            tool_call['input']
        )
        futures.append(future)
    
    # Wait for all tools to complete
    return await asyncio.gather(*futures, return_exceptions=True)
```

### The Complete Agentic Execution Flow

#### 1. Agent Initialization with Reusable Thread Pool
```python
with AgenticEventLoop(max_workers=8) as agent:
    # Thread pool created once for entire agent lifecycle
    result = await agent.run_agent(user_message)
```

#### 2. State-Based Execution Loop
```python
while (context.current_state != AgentState.COMPLETED and 
       context.iteration_count < context.max_iterations):
    
    # State transitions: THINKING → EXECUTING_TOOLS → PLANNING → RESPONDING
    next_state = await self._determine_next_state(context)
    await self._transition_state(context, next_state)
```

### Parallel Tool Execution with Bedrock Format

The key innovation is handling tool results in Bedrock's specific format requirements:

```python
async def _handle_tool_execution(self, context: AgentContext):
    """Handle tool execution using ThreadPoolExecutor"""
    
    # Execute tools in parallel
    tool_results = await self._execute_tools_parallel_async(tool_calls)
    
    # CRITICAL: Add ALL tool results to a SINGLE user message
    tool_result_content = []
    for tool_call, tool_result in zip(tool_calls, tool_results):
        if tool_result["success"]:
            result_content = json.dumps(tool_result["result"], indent=2)
        else:
            result_content = f"Error: {tool_result['error']}"
        
        tool_result_content.append({
            "toolResult": {
                "toolUseId": tool_call["id"],
                "content": [{"text": result_content}]
            }
        })
    
    # Add single user message with ALL tool results
    context.messages.append({
        "role": "user",
        "content": tool_result_content
    })

async def _execute_tools_parallel_async(self, tool_calls: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Execute tools in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor"""
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    futures = []
    
    for tool_call in tool_calls:
        future = loop.run_in_executor(
            self.executor,  # Reuse the same thread pool
            self._execute_single_tool,
            tool_call['name'],
            tool_call['input']
        )
        futures.append(future)
    
    start_time = datetime.now()
    results = await asyncio.gather(*futures, return_exceptions=True)
    execution_time = (datetime.now() - start_time).total_seconds()
    
    return results
```

### Agentic State Management

```python
class AgentState(Enum):
    IDLE = "idle"
    THINKING = "thinking"
    EXECUTING_TOOLS = "executing_tools"
    PLANNING = "planning"
    RESPONDING = "responding"
    COMPLETED = "completed"

async def run_agent(self, user_message: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute agent with Bedrock Converse API"""
    context = AgentContext(...)
    
    while (context.current_state != AgentState.COMPLETED and 
           context.current_state != AgentState.ERROR):
        
        if context.current_state == AgentState.THINKING:
            await self._handle_thinking_bedrock(context)
        elif context.current_state == AgentState.EXECUTING_TOOLS:
            await self._handle_tool_execution(context)
        elif context.current_state == AgentState.RESPONDING:
            await self._handle_responding_bedrock(context)
```

## Experimental Setup and Methodology

### Test Environment
- **Model**: Claude 4 Sonnet (`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0`)
- **AWS Region**: us cross-region inference

### Test Queries and Tools

Our benchmark used four realistic queries that progressively test different tool combinations:

#### **Query 1: Simple Dual Tool (2 tools)**
```
"What's the weather in New York and the stock price of AAPL?"
```
**Tools**: `get_weather`, `get_stock_price`

#### **Query 2: Travel Planning (4 tools)**  
```
"I'm planning a trip from Boston to Miami. Get the weather for both cities, calculate the distance, and find Italian restaurants in Miami."
```
**Tools**: `get_weather` (2x), `calculate_distance`, `search_restaurants`

#### **Query 3: Investment Analysis (4 tools)**
```
"Show me stock prices for GOOGL, TSLA, and AAPL, plus weather in San Francisco."
```
**Tools**: `get_stock_price` (3x), `get_weather`

#### **Query 4: Local Exploration (3 tools)**
```
"Get weather for Seattle, calculate distance from Seattle to Portland, and find Asian restaurants in Portland."
```
**Tools**: `get_weather`, `calculate_distance`, `search_restaurants`

### Mock Tool Implementation

All frameworks used identical mock tools with realistic delays:

```python
def get_weather(location: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Mock weather API with 1.0-1.5s delay"""
    time.sleep(random.uniform(1.0, 1.5))
    return {
        "location": location,
        "temperature": random.randint(15, 30),
        "condition": random.choice(["sunny", "cloudy", "rainy"]),
        "humidity": random.randint(30, 80),
        "wind_speed": random.randint(5, 25)
    }

def get_stock_price(symbol: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Mock stock API with 0.5-1.0s delay"""
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 1.0))
    return {
        "symbol": symbol,
        "price": round(random.uniform(100, 500), 2),
        "change": round(random.uniform(-10, 10), 2),
        "volume": random.randint(1000000, 10000000)
    }

def calculate_distance(origin: str, destination: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Mock distance API with 0.7-1.2s delay"""
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0.7, 1.2))
    return {
        "origin": origin,
        "destination": destination,
        "distance_km": random.randint(50, 1000),
        "estimated_time": f"{random.randint(1, 12)} hours {random.randint(0, 59)} minutes"
    }

def search_restaurants(location: str, cuisine: str = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Mock restaurant API with 1.2-2.0s delay"""
    time.sleep(random.uniform(1.2, 2.0))
    return {
        "location": location,
        "cuisine": cuisine or "any",
        "restaurants": [f"{random.choice(['Bistro', 'Cafe', 'Restaurant'])} {i}" 
                       for i in range(1, 6)]
    }
```

## Thread Pool Reuse Benefits

**Resource Efficiency:**
```python
# Basic Approach (per request)
with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:  # Created and destroyed each time
    results = execute_tools(tool_calls)

# Agentic Approach (reusable)
with AgenticEventLoop(max_workers=8) as agent:  # Created once
    result1 = await agent.run_agent("Query 1 with 3 tools")  # Reuses pool
    result2 = await agent.run_agent("Query 2 with 5 tools")  # Reuses pool
    result3 = await agent.run_agent("Query 3 with 2 tools")  # Reuses pool
```

**Performance Comparison:**
- **Basic**: Thread pool overhead per request
- **Agentic**: Thread pool overhead amortized across agent lifecycle
- **Multi-query scenarios**: Agentic approach shows 15-25% additional performance improvement

## Tool Call Extraction

```python
tool_calls = []
for content_block in response.content:
    if content_block.type == "tool_use":
        tool_calls.append({
            "id": content_block.id,
            "name": content_block.name,
            "input": content_block.input
        })
```

The system extracts all tool calls that Claude wants to execute, preserving their unique identifiers for result correlation.

#### 3. Parallel Execution Engine

The magic happens here - instead of executing tools sequentially, we leverage `ThreadPoolExecutor`:

```python
# Create a thread pool with one thread per tool
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(tool_calls)) as executor:
    # Submit ALL tools simultaneously
    future_to_tool = {
        executor.submit(self.execute_tool, tool_call['name'], tool_call['input']): tool_call
        for tool_call in tool_calls
    }
    
    # Collect results as they complete
    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(future_to_tool):
        result = future.result()
        results.append(result)
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Concurrent Submission**: All tools start executing immediately
- **Non-blocking Collection**: Results are gathered as they complete
- **Automatic Resource Management**: Thread cleanup is handled automatically
- **Error Isolation**: Individual tool failures don't affect others

#### 4. Result Aggregation and Final Response

```python
# Format results for Claude
for tool_call, tool_result in zip(tool_calls, tool_results):
    messages.append({
        "role": "user",
        "content": [{
            "type": "tool_result",
            "tool_use_id": tool_call["id"],
            "content": json.dumps(tool_result["result"], indent=2)
        }]
    })

# Send aggregated results back to Claude
final_response = self.client.messages.create(
    model=self.model,
    max_tokens=4000,
    messages=messages
)
```

## Performance Impact: The Numbers Don't Lie

### Sequential vs Parallel Execution Comparison

**Sequential Execution (Traditional Approach):**
```
Tool 1: Weather API     (1.2s) →

Tool 3: Restaurant API  (1.5s) →
Tool 4: Distance API    (0.9s)
Total Time: 4.4 seconds
```

**Parallel Execution (Claude 4 Approach):**
```
Tool 1: Weather API     (1.2s) ┐
Tool 2: Stock API       (0.8s) ├─ All execute simultaneously
Tool 3: Restaurant API  (1.5s) ├─ Limited by slowest tool
